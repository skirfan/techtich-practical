# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### `npm install`

This directory has both Backend(NodeJs) and FrontEnd(ReactJs) available. So you have to install dependencies in 2 different directories.

1. In root directory run npm install to install React dependencies.
2. Then go to the server directory by cd server and the run npm install for the Node dependencies.

### `npm run dev`

This is the command which will start both server and client. Make sure to run this command: npm run dev.
